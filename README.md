# Swift by Example

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/willhbr/swift-by-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/willhbr/swift-by-example) ![Swift 4.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-4.2-DB452D.svg)

Inspired by [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com). Aimed to give an overview for common things in the standard library and Foundation. All examples should work on Linux using the latest version of the Swift compiler. Documentation for macOS- or iOS-specific APIs is a non-goal.

Rust by example includes these topics, they probably know what they're doing.

+ Hello World - Start with a traditional Hello World program.
+ Primitives - Learn about signed integers, unsigned integers and other primitives.
+ Custom Types - struct and enum.
+ Variable Bindings - mutable bindings, scope, shadowing.
+ Types - Learn about changing and defining types.
+ Conversion
+ Expressions
+ Flow Control - if/else, for, and others.
+ Functions - Learn about Methods, Closures and High Order Functions.
+ Modules - Organize code using modules
+ Crates - A crate is a compilation unit in Rust. Learn to create a library.
+ Attributes - An attribute is metadata applied to some module, crate or item.
+ Generics - Learn about writing a function or data type which can work for multiple types of arguments.
+ Scoping rules - Scopes play an important part in ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
+ Traits - A trait is a collection of methods defined for an unknown type: Self
+ Macros
+ Error handling - Learn Rust way of handling failures.
+ Std library types - Learn about some custom types provided by std library.
