Swift has the standard types you'd expect in a programming language:

```swift
// Numbers default to `Int`
let integer = 5
// If there's a decimal point, it's a `Double`
let double = 3.14
// Quoted strings default to being a `String`
let string = "Hello, Swift {{ site.swift_version }}"
// Booleans, of type Bool
let bool1 = true
let bool2 = false
```

Literals also change depending on context, which is discussed in more detail in [Custom Literals]({{ 'examples/custom-literals' | relative_url }}).

```swift
// Double literals can be assigned to floats
let float: Float = 3.14
// Single-character string literals can be Characters
let char: Character = "ðŸ”¥"
// Int literals can be assigned to integers of different types
let long: UInt64 = 123
```

All types can be suffixed with a question mark to mark them as optional, which means they can either have a value of their normal type or the empty `nil` value. Unlike other programming languages, `nil` is not a type itself or a special pointer location, each empty value knows the value of the type that is absent.

```swift
let maybeAbsent: Optional<Int> = 32
print(type(of: maybeAbsent)) // prints Optional<Int>
let perhapsMissing: Optional<Int> = nil
print(type(of: perhapsMissing)) // prints Optional<Int>
```

You can't have a `nil` value without it having some type of a real value - even if that's `Any`.

If you're not sure what the type of something is, you can check it using the `type(of:)` function. This is the type at runtime, not compile time - so it works on variables of type `Any`.

```swift
let someValue: Any
someValue = 54
print(type(of: someValue)) // prints "Int"
```
